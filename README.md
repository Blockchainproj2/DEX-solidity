# Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Project

## Overview

This project implements a simple decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. The DEX allows users to trade different ERC-20 tokens at specified prices.

## Features

- Add trading pairs to the DEX.
- Execute trades between users.
- Update the price of a trading pair.

## Smart Contracts

### Dex.sol

The main DEX contract that facilitates trading and manages trading pairs.

### ERC20 Token

The project utilizes the ERC-20 token standard for representing tradable assets. Make sure to deploy ERC-20 tokens before adding trading pairs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dex-project.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy the contracts to an Ethereum network of your choice. You can use tools like Hardhat or Truffle for deployment.

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
   ```

4. Interact with the DEX contract through a decentralized application (DApp) or directly using contract calls.

## Usage

1. Add Trading Pair:

   ```solidity
   // Example: Add a trading pair for tokenA and tokenB with an initial price of 100 wei.
   await dex.addPair(web3.utils.fromAscii("tokenA"), tokenA.address, 100);
   ```

2. Execute Trade:

   ```solidity
   // Example: Execute a trade for 10 tokens of tokenA at a maximum price of 1000 wei.
   await dex.trade(web3.utils.fromAscii("tokenA"), 10, 1000);
   ```

3. Update Price:

   ```solidity
   // Example: Update the price of the trading pair for tokenA to 120 wei.
   await dex.updatePrice(web3.utils.fromAscii("tokenA"), 120);
   ```
